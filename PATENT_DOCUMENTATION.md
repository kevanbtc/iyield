## Abstract

A blockchain-based system for tokenizing life insurance cash surrender value (CSV) backed securities with automated compliance verification, oracle-based valuation attestations, and transparent provenance tracking. The system combines on-chain smart contracts with off-chain data attestations to create enforceable securities that maintain regulatory compliance while enabling fractional ownership and trading of insurance-backed assets.

## Technical Field

This invention relates to blockchain-based tokenization of real-world assets, specifically life insurance policies with cash surrender value, including automated compliance systems, decentralized oracle networks, and smart contract-based enforcement mechanisms for regulatory compliance.

## Background Art

Existing systems for tokenizing real-world assets lack:
- Automated regulatory compliance verification
- Real-time asset valuation with proof mechanisms
- Transparent provenance tracking for regulatory oversight
- Enforceable loan-to-value ratio management
- Integrated tranche distribution systems

### Key Algorithms

#### LTV Enforcement Algorithm
```solidity
function checkLTV(bytes32 policyId) internal returns (bool) {
    uint256 currentCsv = oracle.getAttestation(policyId).csvValue;
    uint256 tokenValue = backing[policyId].allocatedAmount * navPerToken;
    uint256 ltvRatio = (tokenValue * 10000) / currentCsv;
    
    if (ltvRatio > MAX_LTV) {
        emit LTVBreach(policyId, ltvRatio, MAX_LTV);
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

#### Oracle Staleness Check
```solidity
function validateFreshness(bytes32 policyId) internal view returns (bool) {
    Attestation memory att = oracle.getAttestation(policyId);
    return (block.timestamp - att.timestamp) <= MAX_ORACLE_STALE;
}
```
