## Audit and Reporting Framework

### On-chain Audit Trail

All compliance-related actions generate events for regulatory audit:

```solidity
// Example compliance events
event ComplianceStatusChanged(address indexed account, bool compliant);
event TransferBlocked(address indexed from, address indexed to, string reason);
event Rule144LockupSet(address indexed account, uint256 unlockTimestamp);
event KYCStatusUpdated(address indexed account, bool status, address indexed verifier);
```

### Regulatory Reporting Capabilities

1. **Real-time Compliance Status**: Query any address for compliance status
2. **Historical Transaction Logs**: Full audit trail via blockchain events
3. **Concentration Monitoring**: Real-time carrier and geographic exposure
4. **Valuation History**: Complete CSV valuation audit trail

### External Reporting Integration

- **SEC Reporting**: Quarterly and annual filings (manual process)
- **State Regulators**: Insurance-related reporting (manual process)
- **Audit Firms**: Smart contract state and event exports
- **Compliance Officers**: Real-time monitoring dashboards
