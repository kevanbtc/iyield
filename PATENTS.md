## Patent Applications

### 1. Tokenized Insurance-Backed Credit System

**Application Number**: [To be assigned]  
**Filing Date**: December 15, 2024  
**Status**: Provisional Patent Application Filed  
**Inventors**: Kevin BTC, iYield Protocol Team  

#### Abstract

A blockchain-based system for tokenizing insurance cash surrender values (CSV) as collateral for decentralized lending, featuring automated loan-to-value (LTV) ratio enforcement, real-time oracle-based valuation, and compliance-by-design regulatory controls.

#### Claims (Summary)

1. **Method for tokenizing insurance cash surrender values** as blockchain-based collateral tokens with embedded compliance mechanisms
2. **Automated LTV enforcement system** using smart contracts to maintain collateralization ratios based on real-time CSV valuations
3. **Multi-signature vault architecture** for secure collateral management with role-based access controls
4. **Burn-on-redeem mechanism** ensuring token supply consistency with underlying asset reserves
5. **Emergency liquidation system** with configurable thresholds and penalty structures

#### Technical Scope

- Smart contract architecture for CSV tokenization
- Oracle integration for real-time asset valuation
- Automated risk management and liquidation
- Compliance enforcement at protocol level
- Multi-network deployment strategies

### 2. Multi-Oracle Attestation for RWA Valuations

**Application Number**: [To be assigned]  
**Filing Date**: December 15, 2024  
**Status**: Provisional Patent Application Filed  
**Inventors**: Kevin BTC, iYield Protocol Team  

#### Abstract

A decentralized oracle system implementing "Proof-of-CSV" methodology for verifying insurance cash surrender values through multi-party attestation, cryptographic signature validation, and IPFS-anchored data integrity verification.

#### Claims (Summary)

1. **Multi-attestor consensus mechanism** requiring minimum threshold of independent verifications for asset valuations
2. **Cryptographic signature verification** for oracle data integrity using elliptic curve digital signatures
3. **Merkle tree proof validation** for IPFS-stored attestation data with tamper-evident verification
4. **Staleness detection and protection** with configurable maximum age limits for oracle data
5. **Emergency override capabilities** with multi-signature administrative controls

#### Technical Scope

- Decentralized oracle architecture
- Cryptographic proof mechanisms
- IPFS integration for data permanence
- Consensus algorithms for multi-party verification
- Stale data protection mechanisms

### 3. Compliance-Integrated Token Transfer System

**Application Number**: [To be assigned]  
**Filing Date**: December 15, 2024  
**Status**: Provisional Patent Application Filed  
**Inventors**: Kevin BTC, iYield Protocol Team  

#### Abstract

A blockchain token system implementing "Compliance-by-Design" architecture that automatically enforces securities regulations including KYC/AML verification, jurisdiction-based restrictions, Rule 144 lockup periods, and Regulation D/S compliance at the protocol level.

#### Claims (Summary)

1. **Automated KYC/AML verification** integrated into token transfer mechanisms with real-time compliance checking
2. **Jurisdiction-based access controls** restricting transfers based on geographic and regulatory requirements
3. **Rule 144 lockup enforcement** with time-based transfer restrictions for securities compliance
4. **Multi-level compliance scoring** system with risk-adjusted participation levels
5. **Regulatory reporting automation** with immutable audit trails and disclosure mechanisms

#### Technical Scope

- Smart contract compliance architecture
- Identity verification integration
- Geographic access controls
- Securities law automation
- Audit trail generation
