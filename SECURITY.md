# Security and Compliance Framework

## Security Overview

The iYield platform implements enterprise-grade security measures to protect ownership rights, user data, and financial assets. All security measures are designed to reinforce and protect the established ownership structure.

## Ownership Security Controls

### 1. Access Control Framework

#### Owner-Level Access
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Required for all owner access
- **Hardware Security Keys**: Physical token requirement for critical operations  
- **IP Whitelisting**: Restricted access from approved locations only
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic timeout

#### Administrative Hierarchy
```
Owner (Full Access)
├── Senior Administrators (Limited Admin)
├── Operators (Operational Access)  
└── Read-Only Users (View Only)
```

#### Permission Matrix
| Role | Code Access | Infrastructure | Financial Data | User Management |
|------|-------------|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| Owner | Full | Full | Full | Full |
| Senior Admin | Limited | Limited | Limited | Limited |
| Operator | Read-Only | Execute Only | None | None |
| Read-Only | Read-Only | None | None | None |

### 2. Technical Security Measures

#### Encryption Standards
- **Data at Rest**: AES-256 encryption
- **Data in Transit**: TLS 1.3 minimum
- **Key Management**: HSM-backed key storage
- **Backup Encryption**: Military-grade encryption for all backups

#### Network Security
- **VPN Requirements**: All administrative access through VPN
- **Firewall Rules**: Strict ingress/egress filtering
- **DDoS Protection**: Multi-layer DDoS mitigation
- **Intrusion Detection**: Real-time threat monitoring

#### Application Security
- **Code Signing**: All code must be cryptographically signed
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Penetration Testing**: Quarterly security assessments
- **Bug Bounty Program**: Responsible disclosure program

### 3. Ownership Verification System

#### Digital Signatures
```javascript
// Owner verification process
const ownershipVerification = {
  signature: 'cryptographic_owner_signature',
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  action: 'ownership_verification',
  publicKey: 'owner_public_key',
  nonce: 'random_nonce'
};
```

#### Multi-Signature Requirements
- Critical operations require multiple signatures
- Owner primary signature + 2 additional signatures
- Hardware token verification for high-value operations

## Compliance Framework

### 1. Regulatory Compliance

#### Financial Regulations
- **SOX Compliance**: Sarbanes-Oxley financial reporting
- **SEC Regulations**: Securities and Exchange Commission compliance

- **CCPA Compliance**: California Consumer Privacy Act
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare information protection (if applicable)
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card industry data security

#### Industry Standards
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security and availability controls
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **NIST Framework**: Cybersecurity framework compliance
- **FedRAMP**: Federal risk and authorization management

### 2. Audit and Monitoring

#### Continuous Monitoring
- **Real-time Alerts**: Immediate notification of security events
- **Behavioral Analytics**: Anomaly detection and analysis
- **Compliance Dashboards**: Real-time compliance status monitoring
- **Automated Reporting**: Regular compliance and security reports

#### Audit Trails
```javascript
// Audit log structure
const auditLog = {
  timestamp: '2024-01-01T00:00:00Z',
  user: 'owner@iyield.com',
  action: 'ownership_verification',
  resource: '/api/v1/ownership/verify',
  result: 'SUCCESS',
  ip_address: '192.168.1.100',
  user_agent: 'iYield-Client/1.0',
  metadata: {
    ownership_level: 'PRIMARY_OWNER',
    verification_method: 'HARDWARE_TOKEN'
  }
};
```

#### Regular Audits
- **Monthly**: Internal security reviews
- **Quarterly**: External security audits  
- **Annually**: Comprehensive compliance audits
- **Ad-hoc**: Incident-based security assessments

### 3. Incident Response

#### Response Team Structure
- **Primary Owner**: Ultimate authority and decision-maker
- **Security Lead**: Technical incident coordination
- **Legal Counsel**: Legal and compliance guidance
- **External Experts**: Specialized incident response team

#### Incident Classification
1. **Low**: Minor security events with no ownership impact
2. **Medium**: Security events requiring investigation
3. **High**: Events potentially affecting ownership or operations
4. **Critical**: Events threatening ownership integrity or platform security

#### Response Procedures
```bash
# Emergency response procedures
./scripts/incident-response.sh --level=CRITICAL --type=OWNERSHIP
./scripts/lockdown-mode.sh --owner-verification-required
./scripts/notify-stakeholders.sh --priority=URGENT
```

## Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery

- **Geographic Distribution**: Multi-region backup storage
- **Encrypted Backups**: All backups encrypted with owner keys
- **Regular Testing**: Monthly backup recovery testing

#### Recovery Procedures
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: 4 hours maximum
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: 15 minutes maximum
- **Owner Notification**: Immediate notification for all recovery events
- **Verification Requirements**: Owner verification for major recoveries

### 2. Succession Planning

#### Emergency Succession
