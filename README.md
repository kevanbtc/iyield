# iYield™ Protocol

> **The Alpha Standard for Insurance-Backed RWA Tokenization**

iYield Protocol is the comprehensive infrastructure platform for tokenizing insurance cash surrender values (CSV) with Compliance-by-Design™ and Proof-of-CSV™ technology. Built as the definitive ERC-RWA:CSV standard implementation, iYield establishes the technical and regulatory foundation that other insurance tokenization platforms must reference or interoperate with.

## 🎯 Vision Statement

**iYield Protocol doesn't just compete in the insurance tokenization space — we own and define it.**

Through patent-pending technology, trademark protection, and standards capture, iYield creates an impenetrable competitive moat that forces any market entrant to either license our technology, risk patent infringement, or appear as technically inferior alternatives with significant regulatory compliance risks.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

### ERC-RWA:CSV Standard

iYield Protocol implements and defines the **ERC-RWA:CSV** token standard — the first Ethereum-compatible specification for tokenizing real-world insurance assets with embedded compliance mechanisms.

```solidity
interface IERCRWACSV {
    function safeMint(address to, string memory policyId, uint256 csvValue, uint256 ltvRatio) external;
    function redeem(uint256 tokenId) external;
    function updateLTV(uint256 tokenId, uint256 newLtvRatio) external;
    function isOracleStale(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (bool);
    function getCurrentLTV(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (uint256);
}
```

import "@iyield/contracts/interfaces/IComplianceRegistry.sol";

contract YourContract {
    IERCRWACSV public iyieldToken;
    IComplianceRegistry public compliance;
    
    function mintPosition(string memory policyId, uint256 csvValue) external {
        require(compliance.isCompliant(msg.sender), "Not compliant");
        iyieldToken.safeMint(msg.sender, policyId, csvValue, 8000); // 80% LTV
    }
}
```

  const { address } = useAccount();
  const contract = useContract({
    address: IYIELD_ADDRESS,
    abi: IYIELD_ABI,
  });
  
  const [positions, setPositions] = useState([]);
  
  // Fetch user positions and display metrics
  // Implementation details...
}
```

### Oracle Data Access

```javascript
// Example: Accessing Proof-of-CSV™ oracle data
const oracle = new ethers.Contract(ORACLE_ADDRESS, ORACLE_ABI, provider);

async function getCSVValue(policyId) {
  const [value, timestamp] = await oracle.getCSVValue(policyId);
  const isFresh = await oracle.isDataFresh(policyId, 24 * 60 * 60); // 24 hours
  
  return {
    value: ethers.utils.formatEther(value),
    timestamp: new Date(timestamp * 1000),
