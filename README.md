## 🏛️ Overview

iYield Protocol is the **first comprehensive platform** for tokenizing insurance cash surrender values (CSV) with built-in regulatory compliance, risk management, and institutional-grade infrastructure. Our patent-pending **Proof-of-CSV™** system and **Compliance-by-Design™** architecture unlock $2.7 trillion in underutilized insurance assets.

### 🎯 Key Innovations

- **ERC-RWA:CSV Token Standard** - Industry-first standard for insurance-backed securities
- **Proof-of-CSV™ Oracle System** - Multi-attestor valuation with cryptographic verification
- **Compliance-by-Design™** - Automated Reg D/S compliance and KYC/AML integration
- **Institutional Dashboard** - Professional-grade transparency and risk monitoring
- **Patent-Defensible IP** - Comprehensive intellectual property protection strategy
